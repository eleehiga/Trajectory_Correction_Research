# Trajectory_Correction_Research
Research Project under the mentorship of Dr. Tadrous. This project is to create an offline algorithm that can take in a trajectory with corrupted, location data off from what it actually should be, or missing, but still having the time stamp, data points and to correct this trajectory and provide metrics about the correction.
